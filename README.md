## Roadmap / outline
- [GridEye](https://fnetpublic.utk.edu/) or similar as a live data source (any grid controller would have good sources :) so maybe this can be an idealab or plugin somehow. not sure yet.
- inverters should be thought of as 4D printers (PV, MPPT) printing into sort universe of Geometric unity, a specific shape or song of power
- inverters in statcom are like tuners for the Grid, balancing it on a per-cycle basis (I think?)
- inverters in BESS modes can stabilize across
- Standard Model as a unique case of SAM-QFT
- ci test suite (targeting 3 levels of validation)
- PyPI package (because why not, and I want to use this elsewhere)
- live dashboard (must install package to view?)

How quantum is life? I have no idea. but I thought about it and came up with this.

I don't know what other implications this may have, and that deeply concerns me. However, the potential application for grid stability, and stability of other systems, is too great to ignore.

The real moonshot: using this model for addiction treatment. will try on myself first.
