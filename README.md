## Roadmap
- (GridEye)[https://fnetpublic.utk.edu/] as live data source
- inverters as 4D printers, printing into a GU universe a shape of power
- SM as a unique case of SAM-QFT
- ci test suite
- PyPi package
- live dashboard (must install to view)
- targeting FQXI's upcoming paper competition: "how quantum is life". I want to make this an open paper that anyone can contribute to. I will set up a trigger that will auto email the paper as found in this repo the week before the essay deadline.
