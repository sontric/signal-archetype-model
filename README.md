# signal-archetype-model
grammar book of physics

## Roadmap / outline
- Read the [whitepapers](https://github.com/sontric/signal-archetype-model/tree/main/whitepapers) for now, this is early stages. Goal is to save the world. help us if you can.
- [GridEye](https://fnetpublic.utk.edu/) or similar as a live data source (any grid controller would have good sources :) so maybe this can be an idealab or plugin somehow. not sure yet.
- If we take Einstein's energy-mass equivalence seriously, then inverters should be thought of as 4D printers (especially in the case of PV, I think), which print power (envelopes / shapes / songs) into the universe
- inverters in statcom are like tuners for the Grid, balancing it on a per-cycle basis (I think?)
- inverters in BESS modes can stabilize across multiple cycles or long durations
- The Standard Model of Quantum Mechanics may be seen as a unique case of SAM-QFT, like a subset
- ci test suite (targeting 3 levels of validation)
- PyPI package (because why not, and I want to use this elsewhere)
- live dashboard (must install package to view?)

maybe this was a bad idea. I hope not.

The real moonshot: using this model for addiction treatment. will try on myself first.
